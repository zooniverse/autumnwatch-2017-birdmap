# Autumnwatch 2017 Birdmap

A visual data map for Autumnwatch 2017.

For context, the Zooniverse is working with the BBC for the 2017 Autumnwatch
programme. Once volunteers provide a sufficient amount of data for the
[project,](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/seabirdwatch) we
want to show them the results on a geographical map, divided by time. It's a
Data Visualisation Tool, essentially.

## Development
